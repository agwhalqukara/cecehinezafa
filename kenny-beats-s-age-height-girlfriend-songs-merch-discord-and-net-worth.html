When Kenny Beats started making cool cash from his switch to Electronic Dance <a href=#>Music</a>, he never forgot his love for hip hop.

His brilliant works in <a href=#>music production</a> have granted him the opportunity of working with some of the finest new generations of rappers. Through depression and a longing for creating something new, he found what he wanted and rose to fame.</p><h2>Profile summary and bio</h2><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Kenneth Charles Blume III</li><li><strong>Best known as:</strong> Kenny Beats</li><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>10th of May, 1991</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 30 years old</li><li><strong>Place of birth: </strong>Greenwich, Connecticut, United States of America</li><li><strong>Education: </strong>Berklee College of Music, Greenwich High School</li><li><strong>Current residence: </strong>New York, United States of America</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> Songwriter, record producer, and audio engineer</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 6 feet and 7 inches</li></ul><h3>Kenny Beats' early life and relationship</h3><p class=align-left>Beats was born on the 10th of May, 1991, in Connecticut, United States of America. Consequently, Kenny Beats' age is 30 years. Also, Kenny Beats' height is 6 feet and 7 inches. He played the drums since he was nine years and played the guitar at 11 years of age. While doing this, he was learning how to make beats.</p><p class=align-left>As a high school student, the producer would invite <a href=#>local rappers</a> to his dad’s apartment to record in a closet that doubled as a vocal booth. Nevertheless, after high school, the young record producer went to New York City.</p><p class=align-left>However, there is no information available yet on who Kenny Beats' girlfriend is.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>While in New York City, Beats <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">applied as an intern</a> under the indie rap impresario Jonny Shipes and his Cinematic Music Group without pay or credit. He always wanted to be associated with hip hop and rap, so he found a way to do this while working with the Cinematic Music Group.</p><p class=align-left>The producer was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">selling marijuana </a>to Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul, and in return, they listened to some of his beats. Eventually, they loved his beats and dropped some music with all the three beats he offered them.</p><p class=align-left>From New York, Beats relocated to Boston, where he studied Jazz Guitar and Music <a href=#>Business</a> at Berklee College of Music. However, he could hardly pay his bills from the revenue generated from his music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7afe14010fc5a6d6.jpg><p class=align-left>The sound maker <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made between</a> $1,000 and $1,500 from selling his beats to musicians. Then, a friend encouraged him to switch to the <a href=#>world</a> of Electronic Dance Music. Eventually, he partnered with Ryan Marks, and they formed an EDM group later known as LOUDPVCK. Since then, some fans refer to Kenny as Kenny Beats LOUDPVCK.</p><h3>How did Kenny Beats get famous?</h3><p class=align-left>The producer's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">diversion to Electronic Dance Music</a> came with a lot of opportunities. He became more popular and constantly shuttled through Los Angeles while making a lot of money. However, at some point, the beatmaker felt something was missing. So, in the middle of 2017, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ended his career</a> with LOUDPVCK to discover himself.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, he found out that his love for rap music cannot be quenched and he rededicated himself to that genre. To do this, he went underground for about six months. During that period, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">learned various aspects</a> of beat production and audio engineering and mastered the art of music production.</p><p class=align-left>The producer's rebirth at the end of 2017 was the beginning of a "Woah Kenny" career. He ensured that Kenny Beats studio became the meeting place between him and rappers. The beatmaker redefined music by giving artists what he felt they needed after conversing with them.</p><h3>Songs</h3><p class=align-left>Kenny Beats' vocal templates are what he uses in his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube series</a>, <i>The Cave</i>. He<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> invites artists</a>, and during these sessions, he produces a beat on the spot with which the invited artists will freestyle. The show portrays the spontaneity of talents. Some of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">songs he has produced</a> for artists include the following:</p><ul><li><i>Hunnid Stax</i></li><li><i>Anger Management</i></li><li><i>FM</i></li><li><i>Netflix & Deal</i></li><li><i>Freddie</i></li><li><i>UNLOCKED</i></li><li><i>Hit Me Up</i></li><li><i>Stone Cold</i></li><li><i>Puff Daddy</i></li><li><i>‘777</i></li><li><i>Jesus Is the One (I Got Depression)</i></li></ul><h2>Who has Kenny Beats produced for?</h2><p class=align-left>Kenny Beats' songs with various artists since 2018 have become hits.
