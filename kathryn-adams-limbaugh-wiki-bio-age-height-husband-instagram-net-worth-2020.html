Kathryn Adams Limbaugh and husband Rush Limbaugh first met at the Gary Player Charity Golf Tournament in 2004 when Kathryn was planning the event and had called up celebrities including Rush; this is when they first interacted.</p><p>Kathryn Adams Limbaugh and Rush Limbaugh kept in touch after the event and officially started dating in June, 2007 which was followed by public appearances together in social platforms and events including some Charity events, and the Christmas dinner at White House.</p><p>The relationship was received with skepticism partly because of the major age gap of about 26 years between the two. Kathryn was the one to shut it down, stating that age is not an issue for her, and saying that she has always had a liking for older men. Kathryn was fascinated by Rush and called their relationship amazing.</p><p>Kathryn Adams Limbaugh and husband Rush Limbaugh got married on <strong>5 June 2010</strong> in Palm Beach, Florida in an Hawaiian-themed ceremony with 400 guests attending – Elton John was invited to perform his classic hits at the wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rushkathryn2a-e1545692054925-1.jpg><p>The couple went to places like Mexico and on various islands trip on Rush’s private jet right after the wedding. On return from their honeymoon, Kathryn filed for work permission at Limbaugh’s mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. Kathryn also nursed him through his ill health and loss of hearing.</p><p>Despite of a lavish marriage in 2010, the couple has rarely been seen in public, and insiders say that they have been living separate lives, even in separate houses, although Kathryn usually travels to around the US by Rush’s private jet. Many state that Kathryn is just a trophy wife for her old husband whom he can boast about and show off to the world.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Kathryn_Adams_Limbaugh_Cheating_Scandal_True_Divorce></span><strong>Is Kathryn Adams Limbaugh Cheating Scandal True? Divorce?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After seven years of marriage, Rush came to know via a news article that Kathryn had been&nbsp;cheating on him&nbsp;with several younger men. In June 2018 Radar Online released a news article, alleging affairs even with a young married man, and with an athlete but none named.</p><p>The news shook the radio hot head Rush Limbaugh and angered him enough to cut off most of her privileges. ‘Rush was stunned and humiliated upon hearing the news’, stated a close friend of his. Kathryn had allegedly been two-timing Rush for several years, but despite the constant news about her cheating, Rush initially decided to ignore the situation as he is ‘too afraid to lose her’.</p><p>Kathryn and Rush’s marriage did not have a pre-nuptial agreement done, so if they are to get divorced, a large amount of Rush’s property is at stake, and Kathryn may win a considerable sum.</p><p>Kathryn has been banned from using her husband’s private jet and nowadays is apparently living with her mother in luxury hotels in New York and Boston.</p><p>After the news of cheating broke out, her husband hired a team of detectives to spy on and gather proof against Kathryn. He also hired few attorneys to stage a strong case against her for divorce, so Kathryn and Rush are now supposedly preparing for a $470 million divorce, &nbsp;but are yet to make an announcement.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Much_Is_Kathryn_Adams_Limbaugh_Net_Worth_2020></span><strong>How Much Is Kathryn Adams Limbaugh Net Worth 2020?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kathryn Adams Limbaugh’s personal net worth is unknown, but with Rush, their wealth is authoritatively estimated to be around $590 million, and his salary $85 million per annum.
