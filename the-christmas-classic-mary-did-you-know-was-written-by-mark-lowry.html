He did, however, have a date with fellow Christian comic Chonda Pierce, which cannot be disguised. The Christmas classic “Mary Did You Know?” was written by Mark Lowry. Despite being a well-known gospel singer and Christian comedian, he has never married and has no children. Chonda Pierce, a fellow Christian comedian, and Mark went on a date in 2015. Yes, the comedian had a good time with the woman and even photographed it. But, as their romance moved nowhere, their partnership seemed to be little more than a wacky date.</p><h2>Mark Lowry dated Chonda Pierce and shared some amusing dating stories.</h2><p>Lowry had a date with fellow Christian Chonda Pierce in March of 2015 when he was 56. The two lifelong friends and comedians wrapped up the evening by doing what they do best: taking ridiculous photos together. Pierce shared the pictures on Facebook and Twitter. ‘In the caption,’ she wrote. Pierce’s spouse, David Pierce, had died of a massive stroke and heart attack nine months before the date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mark-Lowry-1.jpg><p>However, the date did not result in anything substantial.&nbsp;Instead, it seemed like Lowry and Pierce were having a good time; shortly after their relationship was revealed, she told The Quad-City Times in April 2015 that dating a comedian would be a horrible idea.</p><h2>Is it true that Mark Lowry is a homosexual? Said The Benefits of Being Single</h2><p>The rumor that Lowry is homosexual has been circulating on the internet for quite some time now. The supposition, however, seems to result from the comedian’s decision to keep his relationship private and his public declaration that he is single. Lowry has made it clear that he will never marry or have children. When asked whether he had a wife or children in a 2009 interview with modbee.com, the Christian comedian stated that living single has advantages. Lowry seems to be sticking to his guns since, although 62 years old, he appears to remain single and childless.</p><h2>Mark Lowry wrote the Christmas Classic. Did You Know This About Mary</h2><p>Lowry is a comedian, singer, composer, and author. He’s the author of “Mary Did You Know?” a Christmas classic. It’s one of the most well-known and popular Christmas carols, with over 400 musicians covering it.&nbsp;Lowry is most recognized for singing baritone at the GRAMMY Awards and being a member of the award-winning Gaither Vocal Band, in addition to his Biblical music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mark-Lowry-2.jpg><p>His check-ins, gospel singing, and reading sessions are broadcast regularly. In October 2020, he created a let’s read playlist for his novel “Live Long, Die Laughing.” It’s one of his five novels. He now devotes his time to generating material for his own YouTube channel, in addition to singing.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dmLWztdKtpJqrXZi5or%2FSoppmpZGnxm6wyJ1ksqelYrivu9ZmrpqrXay%2FqsDTnqVmmqliuqK%2BymajqK%2Birnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-christmas-classic-mary-did-you-know-was-written-by-mark-lowry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-christmas-classic-mary-did-you-know-was-written-by-mark-lowry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-christmas-classic-mary-did-you-know-was-written-by-mark-lowry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-christmas-classic-mary-did-you-know-was-written-by-mark-lowry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-christmas-classic-mary-did-you-know-was-written-by-mark-lowry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-christmas-classic-mary-did-you-know-was-written-by-mark-lowry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./universal-where-to-see-a-musical-crossword-clue.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./universal-where-to-see-a-musical-crossword-clue.html>Universal Where to see a musical Crossword Clue</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./halimah-kyrgios-partner-who-is-he-singer-sister-of-nick-kyrgios-still-dating-dustin-brown.html>Halimah Kyrgios Partner: Who Is He?
