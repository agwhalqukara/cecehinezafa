<time>18 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class=align-left><strong>When the picture of Thylane Blondeau, six years old French model at that time, caught the world's attention so that she became the youngest model to star in French Vogue at ten years. No one could believe that a younger person would soon break the record. Jare Ijalana, an unprofessional model, took a photo shoot in a studio, and it caught the world's attention again. Eventually, Yahoo <a href=#>Lifestyle</a> named her the most beautiful girl in the world.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/184ae5d7b04ac56b.jpg><p class=align-left>Jare's doll-like shots got everyone appreciating the little girl's natural beauty. This was after her photographer shared them on the Instagram social platform. Jare was captured posing simply and showcasing her enormous eyes, perfectly smooth skin and impressive hair. Sharing the inspiration behind the shot, her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">photographer wrote</a>, "I want to portray the interception between her childhood and adulthood so both stay timeless!"</p><h2>Profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Oluwajare Ijalana</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 1st of January, 2014</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 7 years old</li><li><strong>Place of birth</strong>: Lagos</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: Nigerian</li><li><strong>Tribe</strong>: Yoruba</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</li><li><strong>Career</strong>: Modelling</li><li><strong>Marriage status: </strong>Single</li></ul><h2>Who is Jare Ijalana?</h2><p class=align-left>The rising star model was born in Lagos, Nigeria. She was recently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">extolled as</a> the most beautiful girl in the <a href=#>world</a> after her photos caught internet users in awe. Amazingly, she became the first black and African to earn such a title. But then, how old is Jare Ijalana now? The beautiful damsel is seven years old. She was born on the 1st of January, 2014.</p><p class=align-left>Granted, Jare is only seven, but her look can cause anyone to pause and calmly stare because of her irresistible beauty. Jare Ijalana eye color is simply unique. Her pictures on Instagram integrate her innocence and capture all the natural aspects of the African woman's facial structure.</p><p class=align-left>Even when you view Jare Ijalana without makeup, she is still a charming specimen of the typical black woman. After the photoshoot she did in 2018, things changed for her. Interestingly, in the same year, Yahoo Lifestyle named her the most beautiful girl in the world.</p><p class=align-left>However, with all the numerous accolades and world stage recognition that Jare got that year, one would think that she would have many incorporations seeking her face by now. Yet, the sad truth about Jare Ijalana is that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nothing spectacular</a> happened anymore in her <a href=#>modelling career</a> after 2018. What could be Jare Ijalana net worth is also a question most people cannot answer for now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/bcc6eb26490fadbf.jpg><h3>Jare's career and education</h3><p class=align-left>Jare's modelling career began in 2018 with her mother's input and a wedding photographer named Mofe Bamuwiya, owner of BMB studio in Lagos, Nigeria. Mofe shared Jare's pictures on social media, which instantly recorded thousands of likes. The post got hundreds of comments, and about 5,000 people immediately started following the Instagram account that the <a href=#>beautiful model's</a> mother created for her and her two sisters.</p><p class=align-left>After then, Jare had the opportunity of featuring in several notable events. For instance, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">walked the runway</a> at the London Fashion Week. In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a post</a> that shared on their Instagram page in preparation for the fashion week, it read in part:</p>Too blessed! It is so amazing and I’m so honored to be doing runaway show with all these amazing designers from all over the world. I’m grateful to God my mummy who works tirelessly round the clock and my daddy, words cannot express how much I love you. To my beautiful sisters Jba and Jomi who could not be here I am representing you in spirit.<p class=align-left>Moreover, she graced the Child Summit and Awards event held at the British Council Auditorium in Accra, Ghana, on the 7th of September, 2019. She bagged <a href=# rel=noopener>different awards</a> under the most strategically sound and forward-looking <a href=#>African child</a> with measurable achievement in the entertainment industry as a fashion icon/model of repute and the bravest and most daring categories.</p><p class=align-left>As for her <a href=#>education</a>, Jare and her siblings attend the same school. While there is no information on the school's name yet since the girl became globally recognised, her schoolmates chant her name whenever she enters the school premises.</p><h3>Family</h3><p class=align-left>The beautiful little model comes from a family of five. She has two <a id=https://ukaabest.com/biography/jare-ijalana-biography-age-parents-family-and-pictures/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">older sisters</a>, Joba and Jomiloju. They are 13 and 10 years old, respectively. Because their names begin with the alphabet J, they have adopted the J3 sisters as their alias.</p><p class=align-left>As for Jare Ijalana parents, although not much is known about Jare Ijalana father, her mother played a significant role in the fame that the family enjoys today. So, who is Jare mother? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Her mom</a> is Omowunmi Ijalana. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worked with</a> a PR firm before moving into the banking sector. As her kids' manager, she ensures the children follow some rules that put them under check not to get derailed by the fame they enjoy.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, her commitment to her daughters could be seen in how she monitors their academics. It also reflects on how she took the lead to create an Instagram account that promoted the career of J3. So, where is Jare the most beautiful girl? She lives with her family and is completing her education now, but who knows, an opportunity in modelling might still open up for her later on.</p><h2>Jare Ijalana pictures</h2><p class=align-left>After Oluwajare did her photoshoot in 2018, she has done several others. If you browse through the posts of the J3 sister on their official Instagram page, one can see the vibrancy, fun, and joy that they exhume. Interestingly, there are lots of <a href=#>entertaining posts</a> on the page. Check out some selected photos of the most beautiful girl in the world below.</p><h3>1.
