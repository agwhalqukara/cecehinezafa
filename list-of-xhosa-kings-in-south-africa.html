However, they can also be found in Zimbabwe and Bostwana. Xhosa used to be one united kingdom and was ruled by one king until the time of king Phalo, one of the most popular kings to rule the Xhosa kingdom. After king Phalo, the kingdom was divided into two. This post examines Xhosa kings in South Africa who ruled Xhosa kingdom(s) before and after it was divided.</p><h2><strong>Xhosa Kings Before King Phalo</strong></h2><p>Before Phalo took over the throne, 11 kings and 7 regents had ruled the Xhosa kingdom. In those days, Xhosa had only one king at a time. Unfortunately, there is not enough information about the length of time each of these kings reigned. However, here is a list of all of the Xhosa Kings that rules before Phalo:</p><ul><li>Ntu</li><li>Mnguni KaNtu</li><li>Malangana KaMguni</li><li>Nkosiyamntu KaMalangana</li><li>Tshawe KaNkosiyamntu</li><li>Ngcwangu KaTshawe</li><li>Sikhomo KaNgcwangu</li><li>Togu KaSikhmo</li><li>Ngconde KaTogu</li><li>Tshiwo KaNgcode</li></ul><p>The first Xhosa king is called Ntu. Details about what his reign was like are not known. As at the time he ruled, the media was not as accessible as it is today.</p><h2><strong>After King Phalo, The Xhosa Kingdom Was Divided Into Two</strong></h2><p>Phalo is the son of king Tshiwo, and he reigned from 1736 to 1775. He was Tshiwo’s second son, but his elder brother named Gwali was born by a junior wife. Phalo was born the same year his father, king Tshiwo, died, and his uncle Mdange was appointed to serve as regent until he came of age to ascend the throne.</p><p>When Phalo was supposed to get married, two royal brides came to the kingdom on the same day. One of the brides came from the Amampondo people, while the other came from the AbaThembu people.</p><p>This threw the king into confusion as he was well aware that rejecting any of the brides was going to offend the tribe she came from. It would cause a strain in the relationship between the Amampondo people and the AbaThembu people, and he did not want that.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/1d0a31b433a24766b619e6c2f59e916c-1024x576.jpe alt width=696 height=392 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>To solve this problem, all the chiefs and wise men in the kingdom were summoned to Komkhulu (the great place), what is known today as the town of Butterworth. History has it that one of the older men who attended the meeting brought up the suggestion that saved the day. To settle the matter, he said, “What is greater than the king’s head and what is stronger than the king’s right hand.”</p><p>He went on to add that one of the brides be made the king’s ‘head wife’ while the other be made the king’s right-hand wife. His suggestion was appreciated and accepted by the king, who acted accordingly.</p><h2><strong>The Kingdom Was Divided To The Two Heirs</strong></h2><p>Phalo had five sons, of which two – Gcaleka and Rharhabe – were heirs to the throne as they were the first sons of the two wives. Upon Phalo’s death, the same idea used to settle the dilemma he faced when choosing a wife was used to avert a battle for the throne by his sons.</p><p>The kingdom was divided into two groups/kingdoms, and each son was crowned as the leader of a group. The first subgroup is called “The Great House” or “AmaGcaleka,” with Gcaleka becoming the leader of this group.&nbsp;Before the arrival of the Europeans and colonization, the territory of the Xhosa kingdom was spread across the Mbhashe River to Gamtoos River.</p><p>From Mbhashe river to Kei river was under the authority of AmaGcaleka Xhosa.&nbsp;The other subgroup is called “Right-hand House” or “AmaRharhabe,” and Rharhabe was the leader of this group. From the Kei River and beyond, the Fish River was under the jurisdiction of AmaRharhabe. The separation of the kingdom into two houses made Phalo the last king of the united Xhosa kingdom.</p><h2><strong>List Of Xhosa Kings After Phalo</strong></h2><p>After king Phalo, the different houses of the Xhosa kingdom had great kings rule over them. One of the most prominent kings is Hintsa KaKhawuta from the Great House.</p><h3><strong>Xhosa Kings From The Great House</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/1d0a31b433a24766b619e6c2f59e916c-1024x576.jpe><p>Here is a list of all the kings that have ruled over the Great House of Xhosa kingdom:</p><ul><li>Gcaleka KaPhalo</li><li>Khawuta KaGcaleka,</li><li>Hintsa KaKhawuta – 1780 to 12 May 1835</li><li>Sarhili KaHintsa</li><li>Sigcawu KaSarhili</li><li>Gwebinkumbi KaSigcawu</li><li>Ngangomhlaba KaGwebinkumbi</li><li>Zwelidumile KaGwebinkumbi</li><li>Xolilizwe KaGwebinkumbi</li><li>Zwelonke KaXolilizwe</li><li>Ahlangene KaXolilizwe Aa!
