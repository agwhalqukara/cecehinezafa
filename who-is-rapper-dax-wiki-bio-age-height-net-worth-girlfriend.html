Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Daniel Nwosu Jr. was born in Ottawa, Canada on 22 March 1994 so under the zodiac sign of Aries and holding Canadian nationality – as DAX, his career of a rapper and a YouTuber is what has made him popular.</p><h2><span id=Education_and_early_life>Education and early life</span></h2><p>DAX hasn’t talked much about his family, as he prefers to keep them away from the media’s attention – he hasn’t mentioned having any siblings, which is why most people believe him to be an only child.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/ByvlGnjgS3r/</p><p>DAX spent his entire childhood in Ottawa, and was not interested in rap as he was growing-up, but was rather sporting and was an aspiring basketball player. He was somewhat popular during his high school years thanks to his attractive looks and his involvement in sports, which eventually won him a partial scholarship. After he matriculated, he went on to attend Sunrise Christian Academy where he was named the most valuable player (MVP) in basketball – he then moved to play for Casper College, before switching to the University of Montana and finally graduating from Newman University.</p><p>While he was studying at Newman University, DAX was working as a janitor so that he could financially support himself.</p><h2><span id=DAXs_rap_career_and_other_works>DAX’s rap career and other works</span></h2><p>DAX was very interested in spoken-word poetry during the years he spent at college, and was also a motivational speaker – he eventually decided to combine these elements into his career of a rapper.</p><p>Some of the first songs DAX has recorded and uploaded on the internet were “Black in America”, “Hilly Hilly Hilly Clinton”, “The Basketball Song”, and “My President Bad and Boujee”. He didn’t become popular until the release of his <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Cash Me Outside”</a> song, which he performed with Danielle Bregoli – better known online as Bhad Bhabie (rapper as well) – the song was directed by Thad Swift and has been viewed more than 20 million times since its release in 2017.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DdafoXKUQAEdNrb-819x1024.jpg></p><p>DAX released his first extended play in August 2018 entitled “It’s Different Now” – it features a couple of other rappers including OT Genasis who can be heard on the “Gotta Get It” track. Some of his most recent releases are “She Cheated Again”, “Rap God Freestyle”, and “Killshot Freestyle” songs. He has so far been on a single music tour, in November 2018.</p><p>DAX has risen to prominence mostly thanks to his <a rel=nofollow href=#>YouTube channel</a> – he launched it on 27 February 2012, and there are currently more than 1.5 million people subscribed to it, while it also counts nearly 150 million views of all his videos combined. DAX is using this channel only for uploading his music videos, while he has a special kind of passion for diss songs aimed at YouTubers such as RiceGum and PewDiePie.</p><h2><span id=Cash_Me_Outside_song>“Cash Me Outside” song</span></h2><p>Danielle Bregoli is a girl born in Boynton Beach, Florida US on 26 March 2003 – she became popular after appearing in an episode of <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Dr. Phil”</a> in September 2016 where she said ‘Catch me outside, how about that’ during the show. Because of her way of talking, the phrase was heard as ‘Cash me outside’ – it went viral on the internet and made Danielle popular overnight.</p><p>Using the fame this has gained her, she launched her career of a rapper in 2017, and took Bhad Bhabie as her professional name – her single “These Heaux” appeared in the Billboard 100, making her the youngest female rapper to achieve that feat. In the same year she launched her career of a rapper, she released the “Cash Me Outside” song with DAX, which made both of them very popular.</p><h2><span id=Relationships_and_love_life>Relationships and love life</span></h2><p>DAX is very secretive when it comes to his love life, and he hasn’t shared any details regarding the girls he might have dated in the past.</p><p>While he hasn’t talked about it himself, he is rumored to be dating a girl he met years back while he was attending senior year at high school. The two met during one of their classes and started spending time together, while not being anything more than friends – it took them more than two months to start dating. They have allegedly been together ever since, and have split only once for unknown reasons, however, nothing about this relationship has been confirmed by DAX.</p><p>During the five months he spent apart from his girlfriend, he is said to have been dating a popular female rap star which was allegedly the reason behind his initial split with his current girlfriend. The two were dating for four months before they split, leading DAX to go and win back the heart of his former, and current, girlfriend.</p><p>As he hasn’t talked about his relationship status and hasn’t uploaded any pictures with his girlfriend, he currently appears to be single, hasn’t married, and doesn’t have any kids.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_other_interests>Hobbies and other interests</span></h2><p>DAX is mostly focused on his career of a rapper, and on uploading his music videos onto his YouTube channel, but he has numerous other interests.</p><p>DAX is still very passionate about basketball and frequently plays it with his friends – he is still the best basketball player among them. They have made a team and sometimes compete with other teams in their city. He is very fond of tattoos and has had numerous inked onto his body throughout the years.</p><p>DAX enjoys watching movies and is a huge fan of Marvel movies and comic books – he has seen all of them while his favorite is “The End Game” and he has seen it in the cinema during its first showing. He is not a big fan of TV series, but if he had to choose which to watch, he would go for “Prison Break”.</p><p>He is a big lover of animals, but doesn’t have any pets as he doesn’t have time for them.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>DAX is currently 25 years old.
