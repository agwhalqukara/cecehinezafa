She posted a beautiful snap of them on the beach with a caption that said her last name was about to get a lot harder to spell.</p><p>Moreover, going through Valentine and Shayne’s social media pages, it looks like they have already tied their marital knot. In August 2021, Gina shared a string of pictures of her in a gown and Shayne in a black tuxedo. So, the pair might have already exchanged their wedding vows. Or, possibilities are their marriage is still pending, and those photos might be from their pre-wedding shoot.</p><p dir=ltr lang=fr>08.07.21 ✨ (📷 Lauren Fair) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Q4WHDgTzhp</a></p><p>— Gina Gostisbehere (@ginavalentinee) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">August 16, 2021</a></p><p><br>Furthermore, Gostisbehere and Valentine are parents to three adorable pups, Cooper, Pippa, and Louie.

And the Gostisbehere couple <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">wants to</a> do whatever they can to help their home state.</p><p>Back when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world in 2020, Shayne took to Twitter to share the news of a national shortage of N95 masks. He shared the news in the hope of getting more masks to provide them to the frontline heroes.</p><p>Possibly current Shayne Gostisbehere’s wife, Gina Valentine, a nurse at CHOP, was personally hit by the shortage of N95 masks.
